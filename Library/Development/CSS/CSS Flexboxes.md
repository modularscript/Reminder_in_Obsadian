Flexbox, or the Flexible Box Layout Module, is a CSS layout mode that makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structures without using float or positioning. It is a one-dimensional layout model, meaning that it can lay out items in either a row or a column, but not both at the same time. 

Some of the key properties of Flexbox include:
- `display`: This defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the given value. It enables a flex context for all its direct children.
- `flex-direction`: This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container.
- `flex-wrap`: By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You can change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with this property.
- `justify-content`: This defines the alignment along the main axis. It helps distribute extra free space leftover when either all the flex items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size.
- `align-items`: This defines the default behavior for how flex items are laid out along the cross axis on the current line.

Flexbox also has properties for controlling the size and order of individual flex items, such as `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis`. You can even nest flex containers within each other to create more complex layouts.
